# Introduction

This specification paper is a community-driven initiative to provide a technical specification for Neo blockchain.
It is organized in chapters, describing diverse details of the protocol, cryptography, consensus mechanisms and smart contracts.
Every part of the protocol may be covered here, although it is recommended to keep the scope as limited as possible to fundamental pieces of the technology.
These topics are suggested by Neo community and may be changed in the future, so feel free to contribute.
